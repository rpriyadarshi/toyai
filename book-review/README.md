## Quick Start

### For Understanding the Book's Status

1. Read **comprehensive-review.md**, starting with:
   - Executive Summary (overview)
   - Part II: Completion Assessment (what's missing)
   - Part IV: Phased Completion Plan (how to proceed)

### For Writing/Expanding Content

1. Read **completion-prompt.md**, starting with:
   - Core Principles (always maintain these)
   - Relevant template (Chapter or Example)
   - Specific prompt for the section you're writing

2. Follow the template structure
3. Use the quality checklist before considering complete

## Key Findings

### Overall Status: ~85% Complete

**Strengths:**
- Excellent foundational chapters (1-2, 5)
- Clear pedagogical philosophy
- Strong structure and organization
- Complete code examples and worksheets

**Critical Gaps:**
- **Chapters 6-7** (Embeddings, Attention): Too brief, need 3-4x expansion
- **Examples 1-6**: Need more detailed step-by-step calculations
- **Appendices C-D**: Currently minimal, need 5-8K words each
- **Conclusion**: Too brief, needs synthesis and guidance

### Estimated Completion Time: 10-12 weeks

Following the phased plan in comprehensive-review.md

---

## Priority Order

### Phase 1: Critical Content (Weeks 1-4)
1. **Chapter 6: Embeddings** (5.3K → 15-20K words)
2. **Chapter 7: Attention Intuition** (7.0K → 20-25K words)

**Why first:** These are foundational concepts. Current content is insufficient.

### Phase 2: Examples (Weeks 5-8)
3. **Examples 1-6** (2.7-5.8K → 8-12K words each)

**Why second:** Hands-on learning is core value. Examples need more detail.

### Phase 3: Supporting Materials (Weeks 9-10)
4. **Appendices C-D** (741-932 bytes → 5-8K words each)
5. **Conclusion** (830 bytes → 3-5K words)

**Why third:** Important for usability but less critical than core content.

### Phase 4: Integration (Weeks 11-12)
6. Cross-references and integration
7. Final review and polish

## Core Principles (Always Maintain)

When writing or expanding any section:

1. **Explicit Transformations**: Show every step, never compress
2. **Hand Verifiability**: All calculations with 2×2 matrices
3. **Progressive Complexity**: Build from simple to complex
4. **Observability**: Show all intermediate values
5. **Physical Analogies**: Use concrete explanations
6. **No Mathematical Maturity Assumed**: Teach patterns explicitly
