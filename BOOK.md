## 📖 How to Read

1. **Start with the preface**: [`book/00a-preface.md`](book/00a-preface.md) for what this book is and how to use it
2. **Read the introduction**: [`book/00c-introduction.md`](book/00c-introduction.md) for philosophy and approach
3. **Review the table of contents**: [`book/00b-toc.md`](book/00b-toc.md) for navigation
3. **Read foundations first**: Chapters 1-8 establish core concepts
3. **Work through examples**: Examples 1-7 build progressively
4. **Use worksheets**: See `worksheets/` directory for hand-calculation guides
5. **Run code**: Build and run examples to see concepts in action
