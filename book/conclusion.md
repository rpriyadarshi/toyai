## Conclusion

You've now mastered transformers from first principles! You can:

- Understand every component
- Compute everything by hand
- Implement from scratch
- Extend to larger models

The principles you've learned apply to GPT, BERT, and all transformer-based models. The math is identical - only the scale changes.
