## Navigation

Each chapter file includes navigation links at the bottom:
- Link to index
- Link to previous chapter
- Link to next chapter

## Reading Order

1. Start with `00c-introduction.md` for philosophy and approach
2. Review `00b-toc.md` for overview and table of contents
3. Read foundations (01-08) in order
4. Work through examples (09-15) sequentially
5. Refer to appendices as needed
6. End with conclusion

## Alternative: Single File

If you prefer a single continuous document, see `../BOOK.md` in the parent directory (this is the original combined version).
