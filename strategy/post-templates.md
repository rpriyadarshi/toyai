## Template 1: "I Calculated This By Hand" Posts

**Best for**: Monday technical posts, deep dives

**Hook**: [Use contrarian or proof hook from viral-hooks.md]

---

[HOOK - First 3 lines visible without clicking]

[PARAGRAPH 1: Context]
As an EDA engineer, I needed to understand AI from first principles. So I'm building transformers in C++ and verifying every number by hand.

[PARAGRAPH 2: The Calculation]
Here's [TOPIC] worked out step-by-step:

[SHOW HAND CALCULATION]
- Photo of notebook with calculations
- Or formatted text showing steps
- Reference to worksheet: [link to worksheet]

[PARAGRAPH 3: The Code]
Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
[CODE SNIPPET - 5-10 lines max]
```

[PARAGRAPH 4: The Match]
The code output matches my hand calculation exactly:
- Expected: [value]
- Actual: [value]
- ✓ Verified

[PARAGRAPH 5: Why This Matters]
Why verify by hand? Because understanding the fundamentals makes you a better engineer. When something breaks, you know where to look.

[HOOK - First 3 lines]

[PARAGRAPH 1: EDA Analogy]
In EDA, we [EDA CONCEPT]. In AI, [AI CONCEPT] does the same thing.

Example:
- EDA: Signal routing determines which signals connect
- AI: Attention determines which tokens connect
- Same concept, different domain

[PARAGRAPH 2: The Math]
Here's how it works mathematically:

[FORMULA OR CALCULATION]
[SHOW WITH 2x2 MATRICES]

[PARAGRAPH 3: The Code]
Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
[CODE SNIPPET]
```

[PARAGRAPH 4: The Connection]
The connection: [EXPLAIN HOW EDA CONCEPT MAPS TO AI CONCEPT]

This is why my EDA background helps - I understand systems thinking.

3. Step 3: [calculation]
4. Result: [result]

[PARAGRAPH 3: The Code]
Here's the C++ implementation:

```cpp
[CODE SNIPPET WITH COMMENTS]
```

[PARAGRAPH 4: Visual]
[REFERENCE TO DIAGRAM from book/images/]

[PARAGRAPH 5: Why This Matters]
Understanding this math is crucial because [INSIGHT]. It's not magic - it's just matrix operations.

## Template 4: "I Built X in Y Lines" Posts

**Best for**: Wednesday code walkthroughs, proof of simplicity

**Hook**: [Use proof or comparison hook]

---

[HOOK - First 3 lines]

[PARAGRAPH 1: The Challenge]
I implemented [FEATURE] in [NUMBER] lines of C++. No frameworks, just math.

[PARAGRAPH 2: The Code]
Here's the complete implementation:

```cpp
[FULL CODE OR KEY SNIPPETS]
```

[PARAGRAPH 3: Key Lines Explained]
- Line [X]: [EXPLANATION]
- Line [Y]: [EXPLANATION]
- Line [Z]: [EXPLANATION]

[PARAGRAPH 4: The Output]
Running it produces:
[SHOW OUTPUT]

[PARAGRAPH 5: The Insight]
The insight: [FEATURE] isn't complex. It's just [SIMPLE EXPLANATION]. The complexity comes from scale, not the core math.

[PARAGRAPH 2: The Reality]
The reality: [REALITY]. Here's proof with a simple example:

[SHOW SIMPLE EXAMPLE - 2x2 matrices]
[WORK THROUGH CALCULATION]

[PARAGRAPH 3: The Code]
Here's the C++ code that proves it:

```cpp
[CODE SNIPPET]
```

[PARAGRAPH 4: The Connection]
This simple example scales to real transformers. The math is identical - just bigger matrices.

[PARAGRAPH 5: Why This Matters]
Understanding this misconception matters because [INSIGHT]. It helps you [BENEFIT].

## Template Customization Tips

1. **Keep first 3 lines as hook** - These are visible without clicking
2. **Use line breaks** - Make posts scannable
3. **Include visuals** - Photos, code snippets, diagrams
4. **Ask questions** - Drive engagement in comments
5. **Link to resources** - Make it easy for people to learn more
6. **Use hashtags strategically** - 5-7 hashtags, mix of broad and niche
7. **Respond to comments** - Especially in first hour after posting

---

## Post Length Guidelines

- **Short posts**: 150-300 words (quick insights)
- **Medium posts**: 300-600 words (standard technical posts)
- **Long posts**: 600-1000 words (deep dives, reflections)

Mix post lengths for variety. LinkedIn favors engagement over length.

---

## Visual Elements to Include

1. **Hand calculation photos** - Show your work
2. **Code snippets** - Formatted nicely
3. **Diagrams** - From book/images/
4. **Before/after comparisons** - Show progress
5. **Screenshots** - Of code output, terminal, etc.

Visuals increase engagement significantly.
