# Viral Hooks Library

Proven hooks that get engagement on LinkedIn. Mix and match these patterns for maximum impact.

## Hook Categories

### 1. Contrarian Hooks
Challenge common assumptions or approaches.

**Examples**:
- "Everyone uses PyTorch. I'm building transformers in C++ and verifying every number by hand."
- "Most AI courses skip the math. I'm calculating everything by hand. Here's why it matters."
- "While others use frameworks, I'm building from scratch. Here's what I learned."
- "Everyone says transformers are complex. They're just matrix multiplications. Here's proof."

**When to use**: Monday technical posts, myth-busting content

---

### 2. Credibility Hooks
Establish authority through background and experience.

**Examples**:
- "As an EDA engineer with 10+ years building complex systems, I needed to understand AI from first principles."
- "After building EDA tools for a decade, I thought AI was magic. Then I built a transformer from scratch."
- "Coming from systems engineering, I couldn't accept 'it just works.' Here's how I verified every number."
- "EDA taught me: understand the system before optimizing. Same approach with AI."

**When to use**: Friday reflection posts, credibility-building content

---

### 3. Proof Hooks
Show evidence of deep understanding through work.

**Examples**:
- "I calculated this by hand. Here's the notebook with every step."
- "I verified every number with pen and paper. Here's the proof."
- "12 weeks ago I knew nothing about AI. Here's what I built from scratch."
- "I implemented scaled dot-product attention in 28 lines of C++. Here's how."

**When to use**: Monday technical posts, code walkthroughs

---

### 4. Simple/Clarifying Hooks
Make complex topics accessible.

**Examples**:
- "Transformers are just matrix math. Here's proof with 2x2 matrices."
- "Everyone talks about attention. Here's the exact math, worked out on paper."
- "Embeddings: Converting words to vectors, worked out by hand."
- "The problem transformers solve (with hand calculations)."

**When to use**: Wednesday code walkthroughs, educational content

---

### 5. Journey Hooks
Share the learning process and progress.

**Examples**:
- "12 weeks ago I knew nothing about AI. Here's what I built."
- "I'm an EDA engineer learning AI from scratch. Here's why I'm starting with 2x2 matrices."
- "What I learned building transformers from scratch (12-week reflection)."
- "From 2x2 matrices to understanding GPT: The journey."

**When to use**: Friday reflection posts, milestone content

---

### 6. Comparison Hooks
Show differences or similarities.

**Examples**:
- "PyTorch: 50 lines. My C++: 28 lines. Same math."
- "RNNs vs Transformers: Why I'm building transformers in C++."
- "In EDA, we route signals. In AI, attention routes information. Same concept."
- "From EDA signal routing to AI attention: Same concept, different domain."

**When to use**: Wednesday code walkthroughs, analogy posts

---

### 7. Myth-Busting Hooks
Challenge misconceptions.

**Examples**:
- "AI isn't magic. It's math. Here's the proof."
- "Everyone says transformers are complex. They're just matrix multiplications."
- "The misconception: AI requires massive frameworks. The reality: It's just math."
- "What other AI myths should I debunk?"

**When to use**: Monday technical posts, educational content

---

### 8. Question Hooks
Engage audience with questions.

**Examples**:
- "What surprised you most about AI?"
- "Why do we divide by √d? Here's the real reason."
- "What is a logit? (Explained with a 3-number example.)"
- "What other AI myths should I debunk?"

**When to use**: Any post type, especially for engagement

## Hook Selection Guide

**For Technical Posts (Monday)**:
- Use: Contrarian, Proof, Simple, Myth-Busting
- Example: "Everyone uses PyTorch. I'm building transformers in C++ and verifying every number by hand."

**For Code Walkthroughs (Wednesday)**:
- Use: Proof, Simple, Comparison
- Example: "I implemented scaled dot-product attention in 28 lines of C++. Here's how."

**For Reflection Posts (Friday)**:
- Use: Journey, Credibility, Question
- Example: "12 weeks ago I knew nothing about AI. Here's what I built from scratch."

## Hook Best Practices

1. **First 3 lines are critical** - LinkedIn shows first 3 lines without clicking
2. **Be specific** - "28 lines of C++" beats "some code"
3. **Show proof** - "I calculated this by hand" beats "I understand this"
4. **Use numbers** - "12 weeks", "28 lines", "2x2 matrices" are concrete
5. **Connect to background** - "As an EDA engineer..." establishes credibility
6. **Ask questions** - End with a question to drive engagement

## Hook Templates

### Template 1: Contrarian + Proof
"[Common approach]. I'm [different approach]. Here's [proof]."

### Template 2: Credibility + Journey
"As [background], I [action]. Here's [result]."

### Template 3: Simple + Proof
"[Complex topic] is just [simple concept]. Here's proof."

### Template 4: Question + Answer
"[Question]? Here's [answer with proof]."

### Template 5: Journey + Result
"[Timeframe] ago I [starting point]. Here's [current state]."
