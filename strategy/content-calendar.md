- Views
- Reactions (likes, etc.)
- Comments
- Shares
- Profile visits
- Follower growth

Update this calendar with actual posting dates and performance metrics.

## Content Adaptation

If a post performs exceptionally well:
- Create follow-up posts on the same topic
- Expand into a series
- Create deeper dive content

If a post underperforms:
- Analyze what didn't work
- Try different hook
- Adjust template
- Test different posting time

## Notes

- Adjust posting schedule based on your availability
- Some weeks may have 2 posts instead of 3 (still optimal)
- Quality over quantity - better to post 2 great posts than 3 mediocre ones
- Respond to comments within first hour for maximum engagement
- Cross-promote on other platforms (Twitter, GitHub, etc.)
