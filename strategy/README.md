# LinkedIn Viral Strategy: From EDA Engineer to AI Expert

This directory contains the complete strategy for building AI expertise and going viral on LinkedIn using the ToyAI learning system.

## Files Overview

- **`content-calendar.md`** - 12-week posting schedule mapped to book chapters
- **`post-templates.md`** - Reusable templates for each post type
- **`viral-hooks.md`** - Proven hooks that get engagement
- **`credibility-building.md`** - How to leverage EDA background for AI credibility
- **`engagement-tactics.md`** - Tactics to maximize LinkedIn reach
- **`learning-journey-map.md`** - Complete mapping: Book chapters → Examples → LinkedIn posts

## Quick Start

1. Review `learning-journey-map.md` to understand the complete learning path
2. Use `content-calendar.md` to plan your 12-week posting schedule
3. Select hooks from `viral-hooks.md` for each post
4. Use templates from `post-templates.md` to create posts
5. Apply tactics from `engagement-tactics.md` to maximize reach
6. Reference `credibility-building.md` to leverage your EDA background

## Strategy Overview

**Posting Frequency**: 2-3 posts per week (optimal for LinkedIn algorithm)

**Posting Schedule**:
- **Monday**: Deep technical post (hand calculation + insight)
- **Wednesday**: Code walkthrough (C++ implementation)
- **Friday**: Reflection/learning milestone (personal journey)

**Content Types**:
1. "I Calculated This By Hand" Posts
2. "From EDA to AI" Posts
3. "The Math Behind X" Posts
4. "I Built X in Y Lines" Posts
5. "Common Misconception" Posts

## Integration with Repository

Each post should:
- Link to relevant book chapter in `book/`
- Link to relevant example code in `examples/`
- Link to relevant worksheet in `worksheets/`
- Reference specific line numbers in code
- Use diagrams from `book/images/`

## Workflow

1. Study book chapter → Do worksheet → Implement in C++
2. Create LinkedIn post using template
3. Post includes: hand calc photo, code snippet, link to repo
4. Update content calendar with actual post date
5. Track engagement, iterate on what works
