# LinkedIn Engagement Tactics

Proven tactics to maximize reach, engagement, and virality on LinkedIn.

## Algorithm Basics

**LinkedIn's algorithm prioritizes**:
1. **Engagement in first hour** - Comments, reactions, shares
2. **Relevance** - Content matching user interests
3. **Connection strength** - Engagement from close connections
4. **Post quality** - Completion rate, time spent reading

**Key insight**: Get engagement in the first hour to boost reach.

## Post Optimization

### 1. First 3 Lines (The Hook)

**Critical**: First 3 lines are visible without clicking "See more".

**Best practices**:
- Start with a hook (see viral-hooks.md)
- Ask a question
- Make a bold statement
- Share a surprising fact
- Tell a story

**Examples**:
- ✅ "Everyone uses PyTorch. I'm building transformers in C++."
- ✅ "I calculated attention by hand. Here's the notebook."
- ❌ "Today I want to talk about transformers..."

---

### 2. Line Breaks and Formatting

**Make posts scannable**:

- Use line breaks between paragraphs
- Use bullet points for lists
- Use numbers for steps
- Use em dashes (—) for emphasis
- Keep paragraphs short (2-3 sentences)

**Example**:
```
I calculated attention by hand.

Here's every step:

1. Compute Q × K^T
2. Scale by 1/√d_k
3. Apply softmax
4. Weighted sum of values

The result matches my C++ code exactly.

### 3. Visual Elements

**Visuals increase engagement significantly**:

**Types of visuals**:
- Hand calculation photos (highly engaging)
- Code snippets (formatted nicely)
- Diagrams from book/images/
- Before/after comparisons
- Screenshots of output
- Progress charts

**Best practices**:
- Use high-quality images
- Add text overlays for clarity
- Include captions
- Reference visuals in post text
- Use consistent style

---

### 4. Call-to-Action (CTA)

**Every post needs a clear CTA**:

**Types of CTAs**:
- "Try it yourself: [link]"
- "What surprised you most about AI?"
- "Star the repo if this helps: [link]"
- "What other AI myths should I debunk?"
- "Follow along: [link]"

**Best practices**:
- Make it specific
- Include a link when relevant
- Ask a question for engagement
- Make it easy to act

## Engagement Tactics

### 1. First Hour Engagement

**Critical window**: First hour after posting determines reach.

**Tactics**:
- Post when your audience is active (use LinkedIn analytics)
- Respond to every comment in first hour
- Like all comments
- Ask follow-up questions

**Why it matters**: LinkedIn boosts posts with early engagement.

### 2. Comment Engagement

**Engage authentically with comments**:

**Do**:

- Use generic responses
- Ignore comments
- Be defensive
- Spam links

**Example responses**:
- "Great question! Here's a deeper dive: [link]"
- "I hadn't thought of that angle. What's your experience with [topic]?"
- "Thanks for the insight! I'll explore that further."

### 3. Question-Driven Engagement

**Ask questions to drive comments**:

**Types of questions**:
- "What surprised you most about [topic]?"

- Skill hashtags: #CPlusPlus #SoftwareEngineering
- Industry hashtags: #EDA #Engineering

**Best practices**:
- Put hashtags at end of post
- Mix popular and niche
- Use consistent set

### 5. Cross-Promotion

**Promote across platforms**:

**Platforms**:
